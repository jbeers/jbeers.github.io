# Uncle Darrell's Spanish Homework: Una Poema

This is from a series I'm doing to archive some Spanish homework I inherited from my Uncle Darrell.

He wrote:

Melancolía

1. The sky was a pretty blue one day. <br />
El cielo ~~iba~~(ERA) un bonito azul un día.
2. The next day, the sky was no longer a pretty blue.<br />
El próximo día, el cielo ~~iba~~(ERA) ya no un bonito azul.
3. Life is like that, things change - from bad to good, and good to bad, and back again. <br />
La vida es así, las cosas cambian - ~~de~~ (o __desde__?) malo o bueno, y bueno a malo, y ~~atrás~~ (o ~~volve~~?(VUELVE)) otra vez.
4. All this for no particular reason. <br />
Todo esto sin ningún motivo concreto.

I threw the poem into ChatGPT and this was the image it created.

It isn't the brightest poem. Uncle Darrell isn't always the brightest person.

While I don't think the good and bad in this world are all "sin ningún motivo concreto" I can appreciate that sometimes it does feel that way.
