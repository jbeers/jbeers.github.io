I've wanted to start writing for quite some time now. I don't really have much of an interest in being a "writer" (or maybe I should say "author"?) but I do believe that writing is frequently at the forefront of functional fixes. Do you need to learn something new? Fix your problem by researching your topic and writing about what you have learned! Do you need to teach someone? Write out your thoughts first and your clarity will skyrocket.Are you struggling to understand a complex idea? WRite it out in detail and inevitably it becomes clearer. In fact, I think there is enough evidence of this technique to suggest that writing as a means of learning is actually __the way__ that you should learn something.

## Why I Haven't Been Writing

Yet, for as much good as I believe a consistent writing habit will do for me, I really struggle to begin. I commonly face the same hesitations each time I want to sit down and write. 

1. Fear of starting off "wrong"
2. Fear of writing on the "wrong" topic
3. Feeling like there are no "good" topics to write about
4. Feeling like I don't have anything to offer on a particular topic

Not only do I think that these obstacles can be overcome but I think they are almost completely unfounded. As we will see, my fears can be dispatched with very little effort and, in fact, can be reasonably demonstrated to be in line with the goals of my writing habit.

Let's deal with each point separately.

## Fear of Starting off "Wrong"

First, the fear of starting off "wrong". I cannot deny, this will happen, and it will probably happen often. Is that really a big deal though? I doubt it will happen as often as I think and in reality it won't really affect anything. I can always try again. Besides, when trying to make something good it usually helps to start with something and refine it rather than synthesize perfection on your first try. As long as I am consistent in my writing habit there are really only two possible outcomes - both of which support my goals. A - I will fix the writing in editing and/or, B, I will start over and practice doing it right from the start. Either way I become a better writer and clarify my thoughts!

## Writing on the "Wrong" Topic

Regarding writing on the wrong topic. I'm not writing professionally so my choice of topic is unbound by another person's expectations. The point of my writing habit is not primarily for someone else's goals, it is to improve my thinking and writing skills, the specific topic is irrelevant so long as it makes me better.

## No Good Topics

The third fear, feeling like there are no good topics, is another superficial worry. Like I previously wrote, the topic is more or less irrelevant. In fact, not having a "good" topic could even be a good challenge. Isn't the point of writing to communicate important things to your reader? To some degree that requires making it "interesting". If your topic is mine, your job is to make an entrance, dig and scrape your way through the darkness to find something of value, separate out the treasure you find and purify it into a concentrated ingot of knowledge. Picking a "bad" topic is in some ways a creative challenge to find the less obvious good. It is opportunity!

## Feeling Like I Don't Have Anything to Offer

The final fear, being afraid that I don't have anything to offer on a topic. This thought probably holds me back in more arenas that just writing - I'll be glad to be rid of it! It's true that I am not educated in many topics, but(!) there is a difference between being an expert and having something to offer. In fact there are some experts who's own pride prevents them from adding the value they should. This is actually why I should write. When you push yourself to write on a topic you aren't very familiar with you force yourself to face your ignorance and familiarize yourself with the topic. Ideally, you will start off with your questions and quickly progress towards a deeper understanding of the topic and, as a byproduct, produce a roadmap for others who may have the same questions. That being said, even if you start from a place of pride, you will very quickly be met a choice to realign your unfounded perspectives with reality, all it takes is a little humility!

## Getting Started, Staying Consistent

As with many things, the benefits of writing are obvious, the plan for execution is the same as almost everything else. Get started, be consistent, change when it is necessary. You will almost always make more progress by confronting your ignorance early and making adjustments each time you learn something. I'm glad I took the time to systematically work through my fears. I feel much more prepared to make this a regular habit and finally get some consistent gains.
