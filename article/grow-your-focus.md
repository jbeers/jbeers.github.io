# Procrastinatino Always Catches Me Offguard

Recently I have been really struggling with procrastination. It is a combination of a few separate issues. Doom scrolling, anxiety, fatigue. Many differnet parts of my life have come together to make it difficult for me to stay focused. Procrastination has become my go-to comping mechanism.

Alex Hormozi is an entreprenuer who makes marketing content on YouTube. In addition to business advice he also shares life lessons he has learned. He has a stong finance bro/stoic vibe going on. His videos come across my feed quite often and I usually find them pretty relevant to my life. 

One short in particular has been on my mind lately. He shared about how he would work for hours, then a wave of fatigue would come over him and he would need to force himself to stay on task. Even though this was hard, he found that he got better and better at it. He realized that even though it was difficult to focus himself when he was tired he could still make it happen. Moments after he got back on task the difficulty would fade away and somehting would peek his interest, giving him the strength to keep working.

I find that I REALLY struggle with the transition times and getting started on somehting. Even writing this article - I wanted to write for 10 minutes and publish an article but probably spent 30 minutes putzing around on YouTube and X. Once I finally got started everything has been flowing and I've had fun.

There are several people in my life that I think have an amazing ability to get on task quickly. I'm very blessed to say that one of them is my wife. She has zero issue sitting down and doing the task at hand. I think this week, tomorrrow even, I will realy focus on the transitions between tasks rather than having the perfect plan for each task. I hope that by having a strategy that removes my entry barrier I'll get started far faster and everything else will just flow out of it.

## Some Ideas to Try

* Use boundaries to create transitions that you anticipate and take head on
* Use breaks to revaluate what is best to work on
* Focus on getting started with a task rather than fully planning it
